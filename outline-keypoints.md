# Project Outline Keypoints

## Problem solving
* Will be a movie good or will it be a flop?
* What influences a good movie?

## What Data we are using
* Movie Data from Kaggle
* https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset
* IMDB movie data
* Box office data if neccessary

## How we will solve the problem
* Predict revenue / visitors for new movies in the cinema
* Preprocessing and encoding
* Feature selections
* Binning revenue in different "classes"
* Train test split and cross validation
* Different classifiers
	* Knn
	* Naive Bayes (as baseline)
	* Decisions tree if possible
	* Random forest
* Support vector machines
* Parameter optimization

## How we will measure success
* Different metrics

## What do we expect our results will look like
* Put in a new movie with some data you have about it
* Get a prediction of the movie success
* Multilabel classifier
